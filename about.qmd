Formerly, this site was known as the Rfun site. The content from that site has been consolidated here.

The code for this workshop and this webpage are all part of a single RStudio project that can be [found in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/data-and-visualization/Intro2R). The code-along exercises for this workshop are in the GitHub repository but they are not part of the web site. You can work through the exercises by first downloading the GitHub repository. Then find the exercises within the `_exercises` directory.

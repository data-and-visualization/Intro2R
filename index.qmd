-   Basic

    -   RStudio **projects** and **reproducibility** with Quarto

        -   Import, wrangle, and summarize data

        -   Visualize --- plus simple *interactivity*

        -   Tidy data --- plus *pivoting* and *joining* data frames

        -   Regression --- just a taste

    -   An example of joining data and Exploratory Data Analysis

-   Advanced

    -   Interactive visualization with ObservableJS

    -   Custom functions

    -   Iteration with {purrr}

    -   Tidymodels

## Quarto and reproducibility

This is a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites "quarto website documentation") authored with [R](https://www.r-project.org/ "download R") and the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/ "Download RStudio"). Quarto is part of your reproducible workflow and helps you render your analysis into various formats (PDF, Word, Website, Interactive, etc.)

## First steps

1.  Tour of your Local File System
    -   R / RStudio
    -   Clone code from GitHub
2.  Start a new project by importing the github repository for this workshop
    -   <https://github.com/data-and-visualization/Intro2R.git>
3.  Open the `import.qmd` notebook-file from the *Files* tab in the RStudio IDE

## Pipes and Assignment

Some coding syntax is unique in R and the Tidyverse. You will see these symbols frequently.

::: callout-note
## `<-` Assignment - "*gets value from*"

By convention we use two assignment symbols when creating object names

> `<-` typically used at the beginning of a pipeline or function
>
> `=` typically used within the `mutate` function

**Keystroke**:\
Alt-dash

**Example**:\
`my_vector <- c(2, 4, 6:9)`

::: callout-note
## `%>%` Pipes and pipelines - "*and then*"

We can create *data sentences*, or **pipelines**, by chaining many functions together from left to right.

There are at least three main pipe symbols

> `|>` or `%>%`
>
> `+` only used in ggplot2 pipelines

**Keystroke**:\
Ctrl-shift-M or Cmd-shift-M

**Example:**\
`cars |> select(speed)`

## More workshops

[This workshop and many others](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops) covering topics in data science, visualization, mapping and GIS, and data management are hosted each semester by the **Center for Data and Visualization Sciences** (CDVS). All workshops are recorded with shareable code, data, slides and recordings. You can find the [R-specific resources at our Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu) site. Meanwhile, *all CDVS workshop* materials are available at our [online learning page](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops) --- including duplicates of the R materials found at Rfun.

These addins, or plugins, are highlighted for their seemless integration in a coding IDE.\n\ngptstudio\nThe gptstudio can reference a variety of LLMs defaulting to ChatGPT. A big advantage to {gptstudio} is the ability to stay within the RStudio IDE, interacting seemlessly with notebooks or plain script files. From the Addins menu, get assistance writing code, or checking spelling and grammar. A companion package {gpttools} can extend {gptstudio}.\n\nPreequisites\n\nOpenAI account\nOpenAI API key (requires a credit card but may not require payment)\nSet the API key in RStudio environment. For security, if using version control (such as GitHub), include the .Renviron in the .gitignore file\n\nSetup details are explained at gptstudio. Pricing seems exceedingly low as of this writing but there are no garauntees. The API allows coder to set cost limits.\n\n\n\nRTutor\nThere is a website or a package for integrating into RStudio. Does not require an API key, but paying your way is appreciated. This is a tutor designed to help teach about ai-assisted coding and learn about exploring datasets. A subsection of RTutor automatically runs datasets through various EDA packages.\n\n\nGithub Copilot\nDefaults to OpenAI’s codex LLM based on code found in GitHub.

Works well. Comparison of LLM responses is convenient. Log-out is found in the settings page.\nChatGPT: OpenAI’s LLM. This works well. Free website can slow down due to user congestion limits. Subscription models exist, presumably with less congestion.\nCopilot: OpenAI’s codex LLM focused on code completion. In my experience copilot is less useful in understanding conceptual questions about computational data analysis. Uses the VSCode IDE; a nice app that works with many coding languages including R. VSCode also works with Quarto. The R set-up in VSCode is a bit cranky. If you’re a Pythonite, VSCode set-up is more convenient than R. If you’re an R coder, you might be happy sticking with RStudio.\n\nSummary comparison\nBard/PaLM and ChatGPT (via addins, poe.com, bing.com, or openai.com) have worked well in my tests. There seem to be some usage-congession limitations, especially if you don’t subscribe. See also the tips at the top of this page about using using LLMs for assisted coding."

All the packages we introduced (dplyr, ggplot2, skimr, and even base-R, etc.) are made up collections of functions. For example, {dplyr} gives us the filter() and the select() functions.

If we put a string of functions together we have a more complex function. We may want to apply this complex function to some group of data till we reach the end. In R the basic syntax of a function looks like this\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n\n# Define function to add two numbers\nadd_numbers <- function(x, y) { x + y }\n\n```\nThen we can call that function like this\n```{r}\nadd_nubmers(8, 10)\n```\nThe console will return a response, or we can store that response in an object. Or we can can combine that function with the mutate function and iterate over all the rows in a data frame\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nadd_numbers <- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n\nstarwars |> \n  mutate(my_product = add_numbers(mass, height), .after = mass)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhile the custom function, add_numbers, didn’t save us much time. We can create more sophisticated functions. For example, we can write a function that plots x and y.\nThe function, below, uses indirection syntax (i.e. double-braces) because there’s a difference between an environment variable and a data variable. An explanation of indirection is found in the enthusiastically recommended Programming with dplyrvignette. Essentially, an environment variable shows up in the RStudio environment tab. While a data variable is the name of a variable within an environment variable. For example, in a data frame, a column header variable name is a data variable. Data variables have to be called with the embrace operator {{so that they data can be referenced indirectly. This indirection overcomes a data masking feature which allows for more efficient coding in many cases, even though indirection has a syntactical costs when composing complex functions.\n\nmake_scatterplot <- function(my_df, my_x, my_y, my_color) {\n  my_df |>\n    drop_na() |>\n    ggplot(aes(x = {{my_x}}, y = {{my_y}})) +\n    geom_point(aes(color = {{my_color}})) +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x)\n}\n\nmake_scatterplot(starwars, height, mass, gender)\nmake_scatterplot(mpg, displ, hwy, class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule of thumb\n\n\n\nIf you have to write the same code three times or more, write a function.

While we didn’t write a special custom function, we did use the functional programming approach to iterate over rows of a data frame.

The {tidyr} package has functions to reshape data into tall or wide formats.

    "section": "Why pivot data?",
    "text": "Why pivot data?\nWhy pivot data? Your analysis may require the shape of data to match a particular structure. For example, ggplot generally prefers long tidy data. Once the data are properly shaped, analysis and variations becomes easier. Below is a quick example of using ggplot to format data in a long and tidy shape to create a bar plot. Of course, the plot needs some refining. Hence, improvements become easier to accomplish with the tall data shape. Nonetheless, below shows an initial draft of a bar plot.\n\n\nCode\nrelig_income %>%\n  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = \"income\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(religion, count, fill = income)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the data are properly shaped, variations on analysis becomes easier. Next, I format some variables as categorical vectors (i.e. factors), so that I can redraw the plot for clarity.\nMy goal is to format the vectors as factors using the forcats package. This will allow me to arrange\n\nthe order of the bars\nthe order of the stacked elements of each bar\nthe order of the Legend\n\nI will also change the color scheme of the discrete color from the fill argument, in combination with the scale_fill_viridis_d function.\n\n\nCode\ninc_levels = c(\"Don't know/refused\",\n               \"<$10k\", \"$10-20k\", \"$20-30k\", \"$30-40k\",\n               \"$40-50k\", \"$50-75k\", \"$75-100k\", \"$100-150k\",\n               \">150k\")\n\nrelig_income %>%\n  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = \"income\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  mutate(income = fct_relevel(income, inc_levels)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(religion, count), \n             count, fill = fct_rev(income))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +\n  coord_flip() \n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the un-pivoted, wide data, can be subset and visualized even though this is not ideal when attempting more complex visualization variations. Here, un-pivoted, I will make a bar chart of religious affiliation for incomes between $40k and $50k. Since I’m using just one variable, the code is not hard to compose. But note, the data re not in a tidy-data format.\n\n\nCode\nrelig_income %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(religion, `$40-50k`), `$40-50k`)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy, pivot_longer, data will be easier to manipulate with ggplot2. For example, You can subset the data with a single filter function, thereby more easily enabling different income charts. Below, the code is easier to read and easier to modify if I want to use a different income value.\n\nfilter(income == \"$40-50k\")\n\n\n\nCode\nrelig_income %>%\n  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = \"income\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  filter(income == \"$40-50k\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(religion, count), count)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() \n\n\n\n\n\nGetting more complex, a natural step is to make comparisons across incomes. To do this we use ggplot2::facet_wrap()\n\n\nCode\nrelig_income %>%\n  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = \"income\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  mutate(income = fct_relevel(income, inc_levels)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(religion, count), \n             count)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(income), nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother variation. Again, ggplot2 affordances are easier to leverage with tall data.\n\n\nCode\nrelig_income %>%\n  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = \"income\", values_to = \"count\") %>% \n  mutate(religion = fct_lump_n(religion, 4, w = count)) %>% \n  mutate(income = fct_relevel(income, inc_levels)) %>% \n  group_by(religion, income) %>%\n  summarise(sumcount = sum(count)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(religion, sumcount), \n             sumcount)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"grey80\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_col(data = . %>% filter(income == \"$40-50k\"),\n           fill = \"firebrick\") +\n  geom_col(data = . %>% filter(income == \">150k\"),\n           fill = \"forestgreen\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  facet_wrap(vars(income), nrow = 2)"

Reproducibility is further enhanced by leveraging literate coding(Knuth 1984), tidy data(Wickham 2014), and tidyverse principles(Wickham et al. 2019).\nBuilding computation upon this foundations increases the chances of archiving your work for posterity.

A short list of examples includes statistical analysis (e.g. bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, k-means clustering, logistic regression, etc.), robust modeling (e.g. classification, least squares, resampling), creating performance metrics, tuning, clustering, classification, text analysis, neural networks, and more."

A common R / Tidyverse assignment operator is the <- characters. You can read this as “gets value from”.\nAdditionally, I’m using a pipe operator (|>) as a conjunction to connect functions. In this way I can form a data sentence. Many people call the data sentence a data pipe, or just a pipe. You may see another common pipe operator: %>%. \\> and %>% are synonymous.\nusing dplyr::left_join() I combine the two data sets and then use {ggplot2} to create a line graph of participants by year.\n\nmy_df_joined <- rank_df |> \n  left_join(race_df, by = \"race_year_id\") |>\n  mutate(my_year = lubridate::year(date))\n\n\n\n\nViz participants\nLet’ make a quick line plot showing how many people participate in races each year. Here we have a date field this is also a date data-type. Data types are important and in this example using a data data-type means {ggplot2} will simplify our x-axis labels.\nHere we use the {lubridate} package to help manage my date data-types. We also use {ggplot2} to generate a line graph as a time series via the {ggplot2} package and a geom_line() layer. Note that {ggplot2} uses the ‘+’ as the conjunction or pipe.\n\nrank_df |> \n  left_join(race_df |> select(race_year_id, date), by = \"race_year_id\") |>\n  mutate(my_year = lubridate::year(date)) |> \n  count(my_year, sort = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby distance\nHere I use count() in different ways to see what I can see.

Here we refine the categories into specific levels. We are still mutating the country variable as a categorical factor; this time using the fct_other() function of {forcats} with some pre-defined levels (see the my_levels vector in the code-chunk below).\n\nmy_levels <- c(\"United States\", \"France\", \"United Kingdom\", \"Spain\")\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(country = fct_other(country, keep = my_levels)) |> \n  count(my_year, country, sort = TRUE) |> \n  drop_na(country) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n, color = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry race-host\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  drop_na(country) |> \n  mutate(country = fct_lump_n(country, n = 7)) |>\n  count(country, sort = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = fct_reorder(country, n))) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationality of runner\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  mutate(nationality = fct_lump_n(nationality, n = 7)) |> \n  count(nationality, sort = TRUE) |> \n  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(nationality, n))) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique participants\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  distinct(my_year, runner) |> \n  count(my_year) |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, n)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant frequency separated by gender\nNote the use of count, if_else, as.character, and group_by to transform the data for visualizing. Meanwhile, the visual bar graph is a proportional graph with the y-axis label by percentage. We do this by manipulating the plot scales. Scales are also used to choose colors from a predefined palette (i.e. “Dark2”.) Findally, we facet the plot by gender (See facet_wrap()).\n\nmy_df_joined |> \n  count(my_year, gender, runner, sort = TRUE) |> \n  mutate(n_category = if_else(n >= 5, \"more\", as.character(n))) |> \n  group_by(my_year) |> \n  mutate(total_races = sum(n)) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  ggplot(aes(my_year, total_races))  +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = fct_rev(n_category)), position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(gender)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPace per mile\nWe want to calculate a value for each runner’s pace (i.e. minute_miles). We have to create and convert a character data-type of the time variable into a numeric floating point (or dbl) data-type so that we can calculate pace (i.e. race-minutes divided by distance.) These data transformations required a lot of manipulation as I was thinking through my goal. I could optimized this code, perhaps. However it works and I’ve got other things to do.

    "text": "Steps to Visualization\n\nDraw the base layer\nThis feels like, and looks like, you drew an empty box. This is the foundation canvas layer for the resulting visualization.\n\n\n\n\nstarwars %>% \n  ggplot() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap the aesthetics to variables in the data frame\nStill doesn’t look like much. {ggplot2} will initialize the plot scales and labels based on the values of the variables in the data frame.\n\nstarwars %>% \n  filter(mass < 500) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(height, mass))\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, I subset the data, removing any Star Wars characters weighing more than 500 Kg – dplyr::filter(). Then I initialized the base layer and map the x-axis to height, and the y-axis to mass. ggplot drew the scales for me.\n\n\nVisualize a layer\nSince I have two numeric variables, height and mass, I’ll start with a scatter plot. Scatter plots are generated by the geom_point() function.\n\nstarwars %>% \n  filter(mass < 500) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(height, mass)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal v local arguments\nSo far, the aesthetics are mapped in the aes() function within the initial ggplot function. As such, these values are mapped globally and all layers are affected by this mapping. See the aes() function, above. Arguments can also be mapped locally, within a geom function layer, as as geom_point(aes(height, mass)).\n\nstarwars %>% \n  filter(mass < 500) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(height, mass)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping v Setting\nDataframe values can be mapped inside the aesthetic, aes(), to visualize variable dataframe values. Alternatively, data values can be set as an argument outside the aes() function but inside the geom_ function. This is done to affect a visual quality that is manually assigned, as opposed to being derived from variable data values.\nAesthetic arguments include:\n\ncolor\nfill\nsize\nlinetype\nopacity\nshape\nand more. See documentation for each geom_ layer.\n\n\nMapping: color is mapped inside aes() function. In this case, color = starwars$gender\n\n\nstarwars %>% \n  filter(mass < 500) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  # geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender))\n  geom_point(aes(height, mass, color = gender))\n\n\n\n\nNotice the legend was drawn automatically, above, by mapping an aesthetic\n\nSetting: The color argument can be set outside the aes() function, but within the geom_ function. In this case with color = \"goldenrod\"\n\n\nstarwars %>% \n  filter(mass < 500) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(height, mass), color = \"goldenrod\")"

Data types in R can be simple distinctions useful in efficient computation, such as calculating numeric outcomes versus manipulating character data (i.e. string or text data). R data types are rich and sometimes complex. Staying simple, text data consisting of categories, may be efficiently handled as a factor data type. For example, eye colors can be categorized. Brown, blue, and green are nominal categorical values for the factor variable eye_color. Among other things, treating eye_color as a factor data type enables visually ordering categorical values by frequency.\n\nBefore arranging order\n\nmsleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(vore)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranging order with \\\\{forcats\\\\}\nChange the order of the bars by the frequency of observations using forcats::fct_infreq()\n\nmsleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(vore))) +\n  geom_bar() \n\n\n\n\nNotice below, we use the fill = argument to set the color of an individual bar.

Read more about scales.\nViridis scales apply color palettes to continuous, discrete, or binned data. For discrete data we can use the scale_fill_viridis_d() function.\n\nBy using one the scale_fill_ functions, we are able to affect the variable values associated in the fill = conservation argument.\n\n\nmy_plot <- msleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(vore), sleep_total)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = conservation))\n\nmy_plot +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = \"grey80\")\n\n\n\n\nThe color brewer palette is similar but has a wider array of palettes to choose from. Below we use scale_fill_brewer() and a default qualitative color palette by setting the type = argument to qual (for qualitative). Alternatively, or additionally, we could assign a palette = argument to choose a particular ColorBrewer palette, such as choosing the “Dark2” palette with the argument palette = \"Dark2\"\n\nmy_plot +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", na.value = \"grey80\") \n\n\n\n\nSometimes a manual scale is preferred.

Beyond using scales to modify colors, another example is logarithmic scales to account for data skew. In this way you can clarify the data pattern. For example, using the ChickWeight dataset, we visualize the weights of the chicks over time. Hint: You can visualize the data skew with a histogram, geom_histogram().\n\ndata(\"ChickWeight\")\n\nChickWeight %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Time, weight, color = Diet)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = Chick))\n\n\n\n\nUsing scale_y_log10 we can alter the scale to highlight a more understandable data pattern\n\nchicken_plot <- ChickWeight %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Time, weight, color = Diet)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = Chick)) +\n  scale_y_log10()\nchicken_plot"
